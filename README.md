Takes any PDF and turns it into a book form (A5 pages on A4 paper). The resulting PDFs are printed in duplex (long-edge flip, which is usually the default).

Chapbooks are then simply folded in half. The best page length for chapbooks is 16 pages. Above 24 starts to become unweildly without trimming and securing the pages. Folded chapbooks can be stapled or sewn.

Books are designed to be perfect bound with 1 sheet signatures. To do this, fold each page in half, stack the pages together, and glue.
